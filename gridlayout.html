                <p id="title"> Why do we celebrate Valentine's?</p>
                <p id="poem">
                    Cards and gifts, chocolates and flowers, Expressing feelings in softest hours.
                    A day to cherish those we hold dear, And whisper sweet nothings in their ear.
                    But why do we celebrate this day? For love and romance to have their way.
                    A day to show affection and care, A day to express what's deep within our heart's lair.
                    So let us cherish this day of love, And let our hearts and spirits soar above.
                    For love is a gift, pure and true, And Valentine's Day is a celebration for me and you.
                    </p>
